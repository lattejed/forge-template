This is a clone of [https://github.com/gakonst/femplate](https://github.com/gakonst/femplate) with `dapptools` compatibility removed and a number of other changes based on personal preference.

## Getting Started

Don't. Start with [https://github.com/gakonst/femplate](https://github.com/gakonst/femplate) or [https://github.com/abigger87/femplate](https://github.com/abigger87/femplate) as they're likely to be more up to date and possibly less opinionated. Or maybe more opinionated but with better opinions.
